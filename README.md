# BSAN-6070-CA04-Ensemble-Models
This repository houses my project for BSAN 6070 Ensemble Machine Learning Models
# BSAN-6070-CA03-Decision_Tree_Algorithm
# Decision Tree Classification Model

In this Computer Assignment we create a Multiple models known as ensemble models and tune parameters to discover how it affects the accuracy as well as the AUC of the model. The are tested at the base of n_estimators =100

# Dataset
census.csv is uploaded to the repository. This was same dataset used as in CA03


# Code

Python Notebook: 
Is loaded in this repository. The file name is:\
